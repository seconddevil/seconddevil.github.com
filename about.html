<h2>My Bio :</h2>
<p>I have been an independent insurance advisor since 1991 based in north Toronto. (please <a href="#whyIdothis"> read Why I do this </a> )</p>
<p>If you live in the Greater Toronto area, you�ve probably heard me on several radio stations with celebrity clients like Gord Stellick, Erin Davis and Charles Adler, educating the public about critical illness insurance and other financial planning strategies.<br>
I use multimedia, direct-to-consumer marketing to get the message out in a big way, and my website <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.illnessprotection.com/" target="_blank">www.illnessPROTECTION.com</a>educates consumers about financial strategies, insurance products.</p>
<p>For the past several years Manulife Financial has recognized me as their #1 living benefits advisor and one of their top life insurance Advisors across Canada.</p>
<p>I remain very active in the community as a board member of several organizations and by conducting educational and outreach programs for university students and young families.</p>
<p>My greatest joy comes from my family. I have been married to Rhonda for the past 18 years.We live in Thornhill and are kept busy with our 5 children, 17 years of age and under.</p>

<h2>Why I do this</h2>
<p>My path to this profession began when my late father suffered a fatal heart attack in 1974. He was 50 years old and I was 11, the youngest of four boys. In a sudden and shocking instant, our lives changed forever. My family�s financial health was in jeopardy. There was no insurance, no will, no key to a safety deposit box, no savings to speak of and my late mother (then 48) was forced to re-join the workforce. I�ll never forget what happened to my family and that�s why my professional life is devoted to protecting my clients from �what happens next�. All my <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://illnessprotection.com/testimonials.php" target="_blank">clients</a> are busy and successful people. They don�t have the time, knowledge, or inclination to deal with these difficult subjects honestly and right now. My practice involves �crash testing� your life, working with you to identify and set priorities and then creating the necessary and appropriate programs to ensure financial security for you and your family� no matter what happens. I look forward to helping you.</p>
